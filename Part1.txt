    Their Getting Start documentation is descriptive and well layed out. Reading through their instructions was easy to follow and it seems they put some energy into documenting what to do to easily start using their services. The steps have hyperlinks in them for further clarification if needed which was thoughtful.

    Basically you go to their site and signup with GitHub creating the connection of your repository to their service. You select the repos you want to use, add a .travis.yml file to the repo, commit and push that to GitHub, then go back to your build status page at their site and you can see if the your build passes or fails. 

    Travis CI has been around for a decade having started in 2011. They are trusted by great companies like zendesk, Heroku, BitTorrent, Engine Yard, etc. There are 11k results when searching Travis CI on GitHub. One public repo had its intial commit 7yrs ago and a recent one 24 days ago. From what I can tell it seems to be a reliable service for continuous integration.
